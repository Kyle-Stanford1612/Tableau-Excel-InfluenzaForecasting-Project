# Tableau-Excel-InfluenzaForecasting-Project
This repository contains my Excel files and Tableau dashboards for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. This project culminated in the creation of a Tableau Storyboard detailing when influenza season would impact hospitals and clinics requiring additional staff, and which states had higher additional staffing priorities based on historical data.

## Project Context:

![image](https://github.com/Kyle-Stanford1612/Tableau-Excel-InfluenzaForecasting-Project/blob/main/Dashboard%20-%20Vulnerable%20Population%20Map.png?raw=true)

A medical staffing agency, responsible for providing temporary workers to hospitals on an as-needed basis, requires assistance in planning for influenza season.

## Project Overview:

**Motivation:** The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

**Objective:** Determine when to send staff and which states should be given top priority. If possible determine how many staff to send.

**Scope:** The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Data and Tools Used:

2 datasets were used throughout this project:

● [Influenza deaths by geography](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx) - From the CDC

● [Population data by geography, time, age, and gender](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv) - From the US Census Bureau

**Excel** and **Tableau Public** were used throughout this project.

## Folders:

Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● *1. Project Management*: Contains project brief, early planning/management documentation, and data sourcing documentation.

● *2. Original Data*: Contains original data files from the CDC and US Census Bureau

● *3. Data Prep and Analysis*: Contains Excel files documenting data cleaning, integration, and statistical hypothesis testing. Also contains pdfs of processes that lead to the development of Tableau visualisations.

● *4, Sent to Client*: Contains interim report and links to deliverables (these links are the same as the links below).
